# bshplyr
=======

# bash service music player for arch on Raspberry Pi, no login, keyboard or monitor required, autostarts

Adapted for directory structure (just copy the folders with music in /root/music), creates lists only for .wav .flac .mp3 .ogg .mp4 thus avoiding other files like .m3u .jpg .txt

# TODO:
bshplyr-delete is adapted for directory structure but bshplyr-next is not, as bshplyr-delete also has next button bshplyr-next not needed any more
