# Take sdhc card to abother computer, sudo copy music to mounted/root/music, put back in your
# Raspberry PI and only plug your stereo headphone/speaker jack and power, with at least
# GPIO pin 17 ready to pull to 3.3v with 10kohm for shutting down safely
# To improve sound quality:
# a) buy sound card i2c, avoid USB as it reduces battery life when portable twice
# b) put electrolithic capacitor of about 1000 microfarads on 3.3v rail - reduces noise a lot
# c) use HDMI sound and add the hdmi options in the play function of the script
# From Dave Akerman:
# To use portable with battery 6v to 12 v dischargeable to 4,5 v:
#  -cut pins to 3.3 v regulator
#  -with soldering iron remove the 3.3v regulator from its biggest last pad
#  -connect big pad with right down pad -- 5 v becomes 3.3 v, some devices may not work
#  -from the regulator connect right down pin with big pad, making sure that regulator big pad is free
#  -connect positive from battery to left down pin of the regulator
#  -connect the big pad of the regulator which is free to TP2 ground
#  -connect minus from battery to TP2 ground
# Four 1.2 v AAA batteries provide 3 hours when fully charged, 6 if you disable USB/LAN chip
# Or something like that...
